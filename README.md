# keylogger-project
A totally not malicious keylogger for my cybersecurity course at uni. 

### Basic Goal
Aiming to get a basic, and very obvious keylogger created before I try to obscure it. Sends logged output to a created email using smtplib (email address and pw stored in a file called config.py that the user has to create). 

### Intermediate
Obscured under a console-based calculator app, and converted into an .exe to use on any PC

### Future Goal
Obscured under a working calculator GUI.

### Libraries used:
* keyboard
* smtplib
* pyinstaller
