# keylogger-project
A totally not malicious, really basic keylogger for my cybersecurity course at uni. 

### Basic Goal [DONE]
Aiming to get a basic, and very obvious keylogger created before I try to obscure it. Sends logged output to a created email using smtplib (email address and pw stored in a file called config.py that the _user has to create in the main folder_). 

### Intermediate [DONE]
Obscured under a console-based calculator app, and converted into an .exe to use on any PC

### Final Goal(s)
* Obscured under a working calculator GUI. [DONE]
* Able to bypass Windows defender [???]

### Libraries used:
* keyboard: logging keystrokes
* smtplib: sending emails
* pyinstaller: creating executable
* tkinter: creating GUI
